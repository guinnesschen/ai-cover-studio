🌱 Core Workflow (Studio Experience)

The entire experience happens in a clean, single-screen workspace:

Left: a clean form to effortlessly craft new covers.
Right: a tasteful gallery mood board showcasing your previous creations.

🎬 Creating a Cover (Elegant & Minimal)

Three intuitive inputs, neatly aligned:

🔗 Link (YouTube or Audio): [ paste link ]
🎭 Choose character: [ Squidward 🦑 | K-Pop Idol 🎤 | Drake 🦉 ]
🖼️ Image prompt: [ “Squidward performing soulful jazz” ]
[ Create ✨ ]

	•	Dropdown cleanly styled, emojis subtle but warm.
	•	The “Create ✨” button gently reacts to hover/click interactions.

🌀 Progress Feedback (Tastefully Alive)

Upon creating, inputs fade into a gentle, animated spinner with subtly humorous, thoughtful loading prompts cycling slowly (~every 15-20 seconds):

🎙️ "Fine-tuning vocals..."
🖌️ "Sketching the perfect frame..."
✨ "Almost ready—just a moment."

🎞️ The Reveal (Smooth & Polished)

When ready, the spinner dissolves elegantly, seamlessly replaced by your crisp, animated video—autoplaying gently with a modest volume level. Beneath:
	•	Tasteful caption: "Squidward interpreting 'Fly Me to the Moon' 🎤"
	•	A clean download button with a minimalist hover effect.

🖼️ Gallery Mood Board (Living & Inviting)

To the right, your studio’s ever-evolving gallery quietly stores each new cover as a subtle, elegant grid:
	•	Each thumbnail softly animates on hover (subtle zoom-in).
	•	Clicking expands the cover smoothly to enjoy full playback or download.
	•	Each creation feels like a carefully collected piece in your personal art gallery, inviting quiet exploration and sharing.

⸻

🌟 Thoughtful Touches (Quietly Delightful)
	•	Minimal Aesthetics: Soft whites, gentle grays, muted pastels, and plenty of whitespace; quiet elegance without visual clutter.
	•	Subtle Animation: Button hovers, gallery interactions, progress indicators—all refined and barely noticeable, yet clearly alive.
	•	Friendly Feedback: Polished, thoughtful wording that gently encourages creativity without being overly playful or loud.
